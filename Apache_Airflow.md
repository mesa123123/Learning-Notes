# Apache Airflow

Airflow is a platform that programmatically automates, schedules, and monitors workflows it works both through the UI interfaces and through a "work flow as code" solution

It is not a data streaming solution, activities do not swap data, tools like [Spark Streaming](<./Spark_Streaming.md> "Spark_Streaming") integrate with airflow to perform that task

## Dags - Directed Acyclic Graphs

Workflows are created ("authored") in an interface called [Directed Acyclic Graphs](<./Directed_Acyclic_Graphs.md> "Directed_Acyclic_Graphs or Dags").

## Principles

The principles on which airflow are designed are to make the tool dynamic, extensible, elegant, and scalable

__See More:__ [Airflow Principles](<./Airflow_Principles.md> "Airflow_Principles")

## Installation etc

see the [Official Airflow Docs](<http://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable> "Airflow Official Documentation") for more
