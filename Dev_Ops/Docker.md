# Docker (The Technology)

## What is Docker

Docker is a containerization tool that is responsible for defining the modern standard of containerization technology.
Its function is to create, manage, and (with use of [Docker Swarm](./Docker_Swarm.md)) orchestrate containers that run within a computer.
A large set of its technologies are built from the open-source project [Moby](https://mobyproject.org/).
